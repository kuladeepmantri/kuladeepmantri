# KULADEEP MANTRI

Security researcher

I investigate security problems in cloud and software systems.

I test, validate, document, and build tooling that makes findings reproducible and fixes straightforward.

## 01 WHAT I DO

Cloud security and architecture review
Design review with threat modeling and attack-path analysis.

Offensive security testing
Web, network, and cloud assessments with reproducible findings.

Vulnerability research and validation
Confirm impact, verify exploitability when appropriate, map to real-world conditions.

Writeups
Evidence, reproduction steps, severity rationale, and remediation that is implementable.

## 02 WHAT I BUILD

Security tools
Utilities for testing, investigation, and analysis.

Automation and integrations
Workflow automation that reduces manual effort and improves consistency.

Interfaces
Minimal UI for presenting security data and operational status.

Outputs
Scripts, PoCs, dashboards, reports, and lab utilities.

## 03 TECHNICAL STACK

Python
Automation, APIs, integrations, rapid prototyping.

C and Rust
Systems tooling, performance work, safer primitives.

Linux and networking
Services, hardening, troubleshooting, exposure analysis.

React and Next.js
Operational UI for security tooling.

## 04 APPLIED AI

LLM-assisted workflows
Structured report drafting, evidence summarization, repeatable task acceleration.

Embeddings and retrieval
Organizing security knowledge for search and reuse.

Local inference environments
Running models locally and integrating them into workflows.

Quantum computing exploration
Concepts and security implications.

## 05 COMPLIANCE

Framework exposure
NIST 800-53
CJIS
SOC 2 style controls

Focus
Evidence-driven validation and audit-ready artifacts.
