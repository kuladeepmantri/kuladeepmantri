# KULADEEP MANTRI

Security researcher

I investigate security problems in cloud and software systems.

I test, validate, document, and build tooling that helps teams fix issues with confidence.

## 01 WHAT I DO

* Cloud security and architecture review
  Design review with threat modeling and attack-path analysis.

* Offensive security testing
  Web, network, and cloud assessments with reproducible findings.

* Vulnerability research and validation
  Confirm impact, verify exploitability when appropriate, map to real-world conditions.

* Delivery focused writeups
  Evidence, reproduction steps, severity rationale, and remediation that teams can ship.

## 02 WHAT I BUILD

* Security tools
  Utilities for testing, investigation, and analysis.

* Automation and integrations
  Workflow automation that reduces manual effort and improves consistency.

* Interfaces
  Clean UI for presenting security data and operational status.

Typical outputs: scripts, PoCs, dashboards, reports, and lab utilities.

## 03 TECHNICAL STACK

* Python
  Automation, APIs, integrations, rapid prototyping.

* C and Rust
  Systems tooling, performance work, safer primitives.

* Linux and networking
  Services, hardening, troubleshooting, exposure analysis.

* React and Next.js
  Minimal operational UI for security tooling.

## 04 APPLIED AI

* LLM-assisted workflows
  Drafting structured reports, summarizing evidence, speeding up repeatable tasks.

* Embeddings and retrieval
  Organizing knowledge for search and reuse across security work.

* Local inference environments
  Experiments with running models locally and integrating them into workflows.

Also exploring:

* Quantum computing concepts and security implications

## 05 COMPLIANCE

Framework exposure:

* NIST 800-53
* CJIS
* SOC 2 style controls

Focus: evidence-driven validation and audit-ready artifacts.
