### About Me
Security is my bread and butter — I design secure architectures, perform penetration testing, and work with compliance frameworks.  
Beyond that, I explore AI, design websites, and experiment with new technologies.  
GitHub is my sandbox for testing ideas, creating tools, and pushing boundaries.

### What I Work On
- **Cybersecurity** – Cloud security, penetration testing, compliance, threat detection  
- **AI & Emerging Tech** – LLM experiments, automation tools, AI-assisted security solutions  
- **Web Design** – Minimal, modern portfolio sites & creative front-end projects  
- **Tech Experiments** – Trying new frameworks, APIs, and unconventional builds  

### Philosophy
- Build practical, well‑crafted solutions  
- Stay curious and adaptable  
- Learn by breaking and rebuilding  
- Blend security with innovation
