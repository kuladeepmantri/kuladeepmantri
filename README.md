## About Me
Security is my bread and butter — I design secure architectures, perform penetration testing, and work with compliance frameworks.  
Beyond that, I explore AI, design websites, and experiment with new technologies.  
GitHub is my sandbox for testing ideas, creating tools, and pushing boundaries.
