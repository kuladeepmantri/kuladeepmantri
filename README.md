Local inference Embeddings

Frameworks

NIST 800-53 · CJIS · SOC 2 style controls

01 Technical areas
	•	Cloud security: architecture evaluation and risk-based review; threat modeling and attack paths; control alignment tied to real deployments
	•	Offensive security: web, network, and cloud testing; vulnerability analysis and validation; exploit research when appropriate
	•	Security engineering: tooling, automation, integrations, workflows; repeatable processes for investigation and delivery
	•	Systems work: system-oriented tooling in C and Rust; OS internals, memory safety, performance

02 Work in this GitHub
	•	Tooling: security tools and automation utilities; lab utilities for controlled environments
	•	Research and prototypes: proof-of-concept work where disclosure permits; systems experiments and interface prototypes
	•	Interfaces: presenting security data clearly; minimal UI for operational use
	•	Workflows: repeatable processes for investigation and delivery; integrations that increase consistency

03 Model assisted workflows
	•	Security operations: structured automation for security work; retrieval and embeddings for knowledge organization; local inference and integration experiments
	•	Quantum exploration: quantum computing concepts; security implications and threat modeling

04 Compliance
	•	Delivery: evidence-driven control implementation and validation; control narratives, SSP inputs, audit readiness workflows
	•	Framework exposure: NIST 800-53; CJIS; SOC 2 style controls
