### About Me
I work in cybersecurity with a focus on secure architectures, penetration testing, and compliance frameworks.  
In parallel, I explore advancements in artificial intelligence, build web interfaces, and experiment with emerging technologies.  
GitHub serves as a space for research, prototyping, and developing tools that extend both practicality and curiosity.

### What I Work On

**Cybersecurity & Compliance**  
- Secure cloud architecture evaluation and risk-based review  
- Penetration testing involving web applications, networks, and cloud platforms  
- Threat modeling, vulnerability analysis, and exploit research  
- Experience with NIST 800-53, CJIS, SOC2-style controls, and evidence-driven compliance work  

**Application & Systems Development**  
- Development of security tools, automation utilities, and internal workflows  
- Extensive use of Python for automation, API interaction, and proof-of-concept development  
- Low-level engineering projects in C and Rust for system-oriented tooling  
- Particular interest in operating system internals, memory safety, and performance-focused design  

**AI & Emerging Technologies**  
- Research on LLM-driven security automation and compliance processes  
- Work on model integration, embeddings, and local inference environments  
- Experiments in AI-supported auditing, report generation, and workflow augmentation  

**Web & Front-End Engineering**  
- Design and development of minimal, structured, modern web interfaces  
- Projects implemented primarily with React and Next.js  
- Emphasis on clarity, performance, and clean architectural layout
