### About Me
Security is my bread and butter—designing secure cloud architectures, penetration testing, and working with compliance frameworks.  
Beyond that, I explore AI, design modern websites, and experiment with new technologies.  
This GitHub is my sandbox for building, testing, and learning in public.

### What I Work On
- **Cybersecurity** — cloud security, penetration testing, compliance, threat detection  
- **AI & Emerging Tech** — LLM workflows, automation, AI-assisted security  
- **Web Design** — minimal, modern portfolio/front‑end projects  
- **Tech Experiments** — new frameworks, APIs, unconventional builds

### Philosophy
- Build practical, well‑crafted solutions  
- Stay curious and adaptable  
- Learn by breaking and rebuilding  
- Blend security with innovation
