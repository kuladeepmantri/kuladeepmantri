# KULADEEP MANTRI

Cybersecurity. Systems. Interfaces.

I design, test, and document security work as usable artifacts.

GitHub is a workshop: research, prototypes, and components that can ship.

## 01 PROFILE

Cybersecurity engineer focused on:

* Secure architecture evaluation and risk-based review
* Penetration testing with disciplined reporting
* Compliance execution with evidence as the center of gravity

Parallel track:

* AI-assisted workflows for security and compliance operations
* Minimal web interfaces for security tooling

## 02 WORK SYSTEM

A map of what I do and what it produces.

| Domain                | Typical outputs                                                           |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Security architecture | Risk notes, control alignment, design deltas, decision-ready summaries    |
| Offensive testing     | Findings with reproduction steps, severity rationale, remediation paths   |
| Threat analysis       | Threat models, attack paths, prioritization, validation checks            |
| Compliance delivery   | Evidence sets, SSP inputs, control narratives, audit-ready artifacts      |
| Automation            | Repeatable scripts, guardrails, operational glue that reduces manual work |
| Systems               | Small tools in C or Rust for performance, safety, and reliability         |
| AI workflows          | LLM integration, embeddings experiments, structured generation for ops    |
| Web interfaces        | React and Next.js surfaces that present security data clearly             |

## 03 OPERATING PRINCIPLES

| Principle           | What it means                                                  |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Reduce surface area | Fewer dependencies, headless-first, predictable services       |
| Evidence first      | Logs, configs, screenshots, and reproducible steps over claims |
| Tight loops         | Build small, test early, iterate based on real signals         |
| Clear output        | Reports that are readable, actionable, and decision-ready      |
| Performance matters | Simple systems are easier to secure and easier to operate      |

## 04 BUILD STACK

| Layer      | Tools and focus                                                |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Automation | Python for APIs, automation, and fast proof-of-concept work    |
| Systems    | C and Rust for low-level tooling, memory safety, performance   |
| AI         | Local inference experiments, embeddings, workflow augmentation |
| Interfaces | React and Next.js for minimal, structured UI                   |
