## About Me
Security is my **bread and butter** — I design secure architectures, perform penetration testing, and ensure compliance with industry frameworks.  
But that’s only part of the story. I explore **AI**, build **web experiences**, and experiment with **emerging technologies**.  
GitHub is my sandbox — the place where I test ideas, create tools, and try new things.
